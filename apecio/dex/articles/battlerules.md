# Battle Rules

## Endless Battle Clause

- Any Pokémon healed by a foe’s [[Heal Pulse]] or [[Floral Healing]] becomes stale.
- Any Pokémon affected by a foe’s [[Entrainment]] or [[Skill Swap]] becomes stale.
- Any Pokémon _using_ (consuming) an _acquired restorative berry_ (defined as a PP-restoring berry like [[Leppa Berry]] or an HP-restoring berry such as [[Sitrus Berry]] that the Pokemon did not start the battle with; for example, one obtained via [[Fling]], [[Trick]], [[Harvest]], [[Recycle]], [[Bug Bite]], [[Pluck]], [[Pickup]], etc.) becomes stale.
- If at any point after the first 100 turns of battle all Pokémon on the field are stale, at least one team does not have the option of switching to a non-stale Pokémon, and at least one side's Pokémon's staleness has been inflicted by a Pokémon of the opposing side, the game ends. If only one side started the battle with the _rudimentary means to perform restorative berry-cycling_ (defined to be a team containing a Pokémon holding a restorative berry as defined above and a Pokémon with [[Recycle]], [[Harvest]], or [[Pickup]]), it loses. Otherwise, the battle ends in a tie.
- The maximum length of any battle is 1000 turns, after which the game ends in a tie.
