# Grounded

A grounded Pokemon is one that is not under any effect that makes it airborne. A Pokemon is airborne if they are part [[Flying type]], have the Ability [[Levitate]], are holding an [[Air Balloon]], or are under the effect of [[Magnet Rise]] or [[Telekinesis]].

Being airborne grants a Pokemon immunity to several effects. [[Ground]]-type attacking moves (other than [[Thousand Arrows]]), the Ability [[Arena Trap]], [[Terrain]] effects, [[Rototiller]], and the [[hazards]] set by [[Spikes]], [[Sticky Web]], and [[Toxic Spikes]] all have no effect on airborne Pokemon.

Several effects also cause a Pokemon to become grounded, which negates any airborne effect the Pokemon may have had. A Pokemon is grounded if they are under the effect of [[Ingrain]], [[Smack Down]], or [[Thousand Arrows]], are holding an [[Iron Ball]], or [[Gravity]] is in effect.
