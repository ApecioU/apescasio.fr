the ssataei tldr: 
	- Current mon:
		- will get OHKOed
		- cannot 3HKO you
	- New mon:
		- outspeeds, walls or resists all
			- predicted move will not 2HKO or
			- predicted move would 2HKO, but new mon is faster and has recovery move

	- i havent tested any of this lmao
	- this is just unbound AI i have no idea if RR 4.0 is the same

ShouldSwitchIfOnlyBadMovesLeft: 
		- no usable status move
		- bunch of stuff about trapping/substitute/knock off whatever
		- current AI cannot 3HKO
	New switch must: wall/resist (outspeed isnt good enough)
	
ShouldSwitchToAvoidDeath: 
	Criteria:
		- must be slower or die to priority
		- didnt just switch
		- doesnt have dbond
		- if paralyzed, not below 33%
		- will not take more than 33% from hazards on reentry
		- not below 20% if new mon doesnt outspeed+resist all
	New switch must:
		- outspeed, walls or resist all
			- predicted move will not 2HKO or
			- predicted move would 2HKO, but new mon is faster and has recovery move
		- kill your mon with contact damage, and
			- predicted move will not 2HKO or
			- predicted move would 2HKO, but new mon is faster and has recovery move
			
ShouldSaveSweeperForLater:
	"This is the partner to ShouldSwitchToAvoidDeath, as that function only works on mons that are slower"
	Criteria:
		- if paralyzed, does not have quick feet/guts
		- is damaging class (see sweeper defn below)
		- AI not behind sub, or behind sub but you have a sound move
		- AI will not take more than 25% from hazards on reentry
		- either:
			- AI cannot OHKO you
			- AI can OHKO you, but you have fake out 
				- and AI can be flinched
				- and fake out damage is at least half their max HP (how?)
		- either:
			- u can kill the ai (slow kill is fine)
			- AI doesnt have useful offensive stats raised (or +3 evasion)
				- AI isnt trapping you while youre taking passive dmg 
					- tbh this check is for like everything i just wasnt bothered to write it
				- AI cant set up offensive stats
		- New switch can OHKO you (but kill flags gone) OR:
			- current AI mon doesnt resist all your moves
			- current AI's strongest move isnt a HP drain move
			- if the AI can 2HKO you, it only has a 25% chance to switch
			- else 50% chance to switch
		- Destiny Bond
			- ai will die but can dbond and will move first (incl prio)
			- ai will die but will not move virst, but already has dbond active
		- Choice Lock
			- AI is choice locked and cannot OHKO you with its current move
				- but it can OHKO you with one of its other moves
				- can switch to reset choice lock

ShouldSwitchWhenOffensiveStatsAreLow
	Current mon must have one of (sweeper definition): 
		- 3 attacks
		- a choice item
		- 2 attacks and at least one status/phazing/setup move
		- NOT leechseed + protect
	Criteria:
		- Attack is at -3 or less + Only has physical moves
		- Sp. Atk is at -3 or less + Only has special moves
		- Attack is at -3 or less and Sp. Atk is also at -3 or less + Has both kinds of moves
		- Accuracy is at -3 or less + Can't use any move with Acc 70 or more + not stall class
	New switch must either (not as strict as others):
		- wall/resist (both i think)
		- outspeed + doesnt get 2HKO by your predicted move
		
SemiInvulnerableTroll 
	- you're in the invuln turn of fly/phantom force/etc
	- ai has a switch that is immune/resists (type chart only)
	- should be doubles only? idk
	
CanStopLockedMove
	- you're choice locked/encored/etc
	- ai has a switch that is immune/resists (type chart only)
	- i dont think this applies to status moves
	- should be doubles only? idk
	
IsTakingAnnoyingSecondaryDamage
	Current mon will not take more than 25% from hazards on reentry, then:
	Switch out ASAP:
		- AI is cursed
		- AI is poisoned and it had originally poison heal, but lost it (eg entrainment)
		- AI is on 6+ turns of toxic
	Else 25% chance to switch:
		- AI is leechseeded, has no offensive stat buffs and cannot OHKO
		- New mon walls/resists all
		- or new mon outspeeds + not oneshot 
			- this used to require KO flags but those dont seem to be used anymore
			
ShouldSwitchWhenYawned
	- AI yawned, over 25% hp, can actually be slept (eg other status, misty terrain, sleep clause, berry)
	- AI cannot kill you before it falls asleep
	- AI doesnt have snore/sleep talk/early bird/shed skin/misty terrain/electric terrain
	- New mon outspeeds player (also requires new mon to oneshot?)
	
ShouldSwitchWhileAsleep
	- AI doesnt have snore/sleep talk/early bird/shed skin/rest/hydration in rain
	- new mon must not take a lot of dmg from predicted move:
		- predicted move will not 2HKO or
		- predicted move would 2HKO, but new mon is faster and has recovery move
	then: if AI has either +2 atk/spatk/speed or +3 evasion
		- 25% chance to switch
	else 50% chance to switch
	Notes: doesnt check if the ai can actually use its boosted stat (eg swagger special attacker)
	also doesnt check for usual walls/resists/outspeeds flags
	
FindMonThatAbsorbsOpponentsMove
	This only applies to type absorbing abilities. 
		eg. motor drive counts as absorbing an electric move
		ground types do not count as absorbing an electric move
	Criteria:
		- AI didnt just switch to type absorb
			- note: normal switch CD and type absorb CD are different
		- AI predicts a damaging move
		- AI has less than +3 evasion
		
		- If player's mon is not a damaging class (see sweeper defn below)
			- wont switch if AI just switched
			- else 50% chance to switch
		
		- AI WONT switch if:
			- AI can fast kill
			- AI can slow kill while having at least +1 in any stat
			- AI is not OHKO'd and has at least +2 in any stat
			- AI has a sub and u cant bypass it
			- your mon has been on the field for at least one turn, and the AI's previous move prediction was wrong
			- your mon has a mold breaker ability, or is using a move that ignores abilities (eg moongeist beam)
